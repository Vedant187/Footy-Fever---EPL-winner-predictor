# Footy-Fever---EPL-winner-predictor

## Functionalities:
* Predict the English Premier League team Win or Lose by analyzing technical and non-technical parameters.
* Analyse individual teams and players on a series of the most important features in a
visually alluring way
* Analyse multiple teams and players on a variety of attributes

## Project Workflow:

> Workflow:

* Data Collection: The project starts by collecting data from the web using web scraping techniques. The chosen data source is fbref.com, a website that offers comprehensive statistical data on various football leagues, including player and team performance metrics.

* Data Preprocessing: After obtaining the data, the team performs data preprocessing to clean, transform, and convert it into a usable format. Handling missing values, removing irrelevant information, and encoding categorical variables are some of the essential preprocessing steps.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project conducts EDA to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. Visualization techniques are used to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers. EDA also assists in selecting relevant features for model building.

* Feature Engineering: Based on insights from EDA, feature engineering is performed to create meaningful and informative features for the model. It involves selecting, transforming, and combining attributes to improve the model's predictive power.

* Model Building: The core of the project involves building a machine learning model to predict the winner of EPL matches. Various classification algorithms, such as Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree, are explored to select the best-performing model.

* Model Training and Evaluation: The selected model is trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation is used to ensure robustness and estimate the model's generalization error.

* Results and Interpretation: The project presents the results of the model's predictions and provides interpretations of the key factors influencing match outcomes. Visualizations and insights gained from the model help users make informed decisions about team performance and predictions.

* Conclusion and Next Steps: The project concludes with a summary of the findings and the performance of the EPL winner prediction system. It also discusses potential areas for improvement and future enhancements to the model, such as incorporating additional data sources or exploring advanced machine learning techniques
